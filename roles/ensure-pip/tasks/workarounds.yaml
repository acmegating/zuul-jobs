# Somehow on SuSE 15 the dependencies are such that python2-pip can be
# installed, but setuptools is not.  This breaks Ansible's pip: which
# does a direct import of pkg_resources and thus has a hard-dependency
# on setuptools.  This doesn't appear to happen for python3.  Thus we
# ensure this is installed, even if we skipped install phase because
# pip looked like it was installed already.

# Part of this role is exporting a working virtualenv_command for you
# -- on Debuntu, the presence of venv (i.e. "python3 -m venv --help"
# works) doesn't actually mean venv works ... that's just a stub that
# will give you an error telling you the python3-venv package isn't
# installed.
#
# It's quite possible we have pip and so have skipped installing from
# packages, where we would have brought this in.  To avoid requiring
# sudo, which is the whole point of probing for pip and skipping
# install if we have it, we probe for the package here and only
# install if required.
